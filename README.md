‚ù§Ô∏è Full Heart Disease Prediction
Sprints x Microsoft ‚Äì AI & Machine Learning Track (Final Project)








üß† Project Overview

This project was developed as the final capstone of the Sprints x Microsoft Summer Camp (AI & Machine Learning Track).
It focuses on building an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to predict heart disease based on medical and lifestyle data.

The goal was to explore the full ML workflow ‚Äî from data preprocessing and analysis to model deployment ‚Äî demonstrating both technical and practical understanding of AI systems.

üéØ Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships.

Build and compare multiple supervised learning models.

Apply dimensionality reduction and hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.

Deploy a Streamlit web app for real-time heart disease prediction.

üß© Project Pipeline
1. Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values and data encoding (Label & One-Hot Encoding).

Standardized numerical features for balanced model performance.

Split dataset into training and testing sets.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized distributions, correlations, and outliers using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Detected significant health indicators like cholesterol, age, and resting blood pressure.

3. Dimensionality Reduction

Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce feature space while retaining key information.

4. Model Building

Built and evaluated multiple ML models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Naive Bayes

5. Evaluation Metrics

Models were evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

ROC & AUC Curves

Confusion Matrix

üèÜ Best Model: Random Forest

Accuracy: 92%

AUC: 0.95

6. Unsupervised Learning
